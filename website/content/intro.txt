Slony-I - introduction
#
	<p><b>Slony-I</b> is a "master to multiple slaves"
          replication system supporting cascading (<em>e.g.</em> - a node can feed another node which feeds another node...)  and failover.</p>

          <p>The <i>big picture</i> for the development of Slony-I is
          that it is a master-slave replication system that includes
          all features and capabilities needed to replicate large
          databases to a reasonably limited number of slave
          systems.</p>

          <p>Slony-I is a system designed for use at data centers and
          backup sites, where the normal mode of operation is that all
          nodes are available.</p>

          <p>A fairly extensive "admin guide" comprising material in
          the CVS tree may be found <a href=
          "http://linuxdatabases.info/info/slony.html">here</a>. There
          is also a <a href="/documentation/">local copy</a>.</p>

          <p>The original design document is available <a href=
