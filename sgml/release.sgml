   <title>Overview</title>

   <para>
    Major changes in this release:

    <variablelist>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>
       Microsoft Windows Native Server
      </term>

      <listitem>
       <para>
        This is the first <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> release
        to run natively on <trademark class=registered>Microsoft Windows</> as
        a server. It can run as a <productname>Windows</> service. This
        release supports NT-based Windows releases like
        <productname>Windows 2000</>, <productname>Windows XP</>, and
        <productname>Windows 2003</>. Older releases like
        <productname>Windows 95</>, <productname>Windows 98</>, and
        <productname>Windows ME</> are not supported because these operating
        systems do not have the infrastructure to support
        <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>. A separate installer
        project has been created to ease installation on
        <productname>Windows</> &mdash; see <ulink
        url="http://pgfoundry.org/projects/pginstaller">
        http://pgfoundry.org/projects/pginstaller</ulink>.
       </para>

       <para>
        Although tested throughout our release cycle, the Windows port
        does not have the benefit of years of use in production
        environments that <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> has on
        Unix platforms.  Therefore it should be treated with the same
        level of caution as you would a new product.
       </para>

       <para>
        Previous releases required the Unix emulation toolkit
        <productname>Cygwin</> in order to run the server on Windows
        operating systems.  <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> has
        supported native clients on Windows for many years.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>
       Savepoints
      </term>

      <listitem>
       <para>
        Savepoints allow specific parts of a transaction to be aborted
        without affecting the remainder of the transaction. Prior
        releases had no such capability; there was no way to recover
        from a statement failure within a transaction except by
        aborting the whole transaction. This feature is valuable for
        application writers who require error recovery within a
        complex transaction.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>
       Point-In-Time Recovery
      </term>

      <listitem>
       <para>
        In previous releases there was no way to recover from disk
        drive failure except to restore from a previous backup or use
        a standby replication server.  Point-in-time recovery allows
        continuous backup of the server.  You can recover either to
        the point of failure or to some transaction in the past.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>
       Tablespaces
      </term>

      <listitem>
       <para>
        Tablespaces allow administrators to select different file systems
        for storage of individual tables, indexes, and databases.
        This improves performance and control over disk space
        usage. Prior releases used <application>initlocation</> and
        manual symlink management for such tasks.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>
       Improved Buffer Management, <command>CHECKPOINT</command>,
       <command>VACUUM</command>
      </term>

      <listitem>
       <para>
        This release has a more intelligent buffer replacement strategy,
        which will make better use of available shared buffers and
        improve performance. The performance impact of vacuum and
        checkpoints is also lessened.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>
       Change Column Types
      </term>

      <listitem>
       <para>
        A column's data type can now be changed with <command>ALTER
        TABLE</command>.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>
       New Perl Server-Side Language
      </term>

      <listitem>
       <para>
        A new version of the <application>plperl</> server-side language now
        supports a persistent shared storage area, triggers, returning records
        and arrays of records, and SPI calls to access the database.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>
        Comma-separated-value (CSV) support in <command>COPY</command>
      </term>

      <listitem>
       <para>
        <command>COPY</command> can now read and write
        comma-separated-value files. It has the flexibility to
        interpret non-standard quoting and separation characters too.
       </para>
      </listitem>

   <title>Migration to version 8.0</title>
                                      
   <para>
    A dump/restore using <application>pg_dump</application> is
    required for those wishing to migrate data from any previous
    release.
   </para>
   
   <para>
    Observe the following incompatibilities:

    <itemizedlist>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       In <option>READ COMMITTED</> serialization mode, volatile functions
       now see the results of concurrent transactions committed up to the
       beginning of each statement within the function, rather than up to the
       beginning of the interactive command that called the function.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       Functions declared <option>STABLE</> or <option>IMMUTABLE</> always
       use the snapshot of the calling query, and therefore do not see the
       effects of actions taken after the calling query starts, whether in
       their own transaction or other transactions.  Such a function must be
       read-only, too, meaning that it cannot use any SQL commands other than
       <command>SELECT</>.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       Non-deferred <option>AFTER</> triggers are now fired immediately
       after completion of the triggering query, rather than upon
       finishing the current interactive command. This makes a
       difference when the triggering query occurred within a function:
       the trigger is invoked before the function proceeds to its next
       operation.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       Server configuration parameters <varname>virtual_host</> and
       <varname>tcpip_socket</> have been replaced with a more general
       parameter <varname>listen_addresses</>. Also, the server now listens on
       <literal>localhost</> by default, which eliminates the need for the
       <literal>-i</> postmaster switch in many scenarios.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       Server configuration parameters <varname>SortMem</> and
       <varname>VacuumMem</> have been renamed to <varname>work_mem</>
       and <varname>maintenance_work_mem</> to better reflect their
       use. The original names are still supported in
       <command>SET</command> and <command>SHOW</command>.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       Server configuration parameters <varname>log_pid</>,
       <varname>log_timestamp</>, and <varname>log_source_port</> have been
       replaced with a more general parameter <varname>log_line_prefix</>.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       Server configuration parameter <varname>syslog</> has been
       replaced with a more logical <varname>log_destination</> variable to
       control the log output destination.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       Server configuration parameter <varname>log_statement</> has been
       changed so it can selectively log just database modification or
       data definition statements.  Server configuration parameter
       <varname>log_duration</> now prints only when <varname>log_statement</>
       prints the query.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       Server configuration parameter <varname>max_expr_depth</> parameter has
       been replaced with <varname>max_stack_depth</> which measures the
       physical stack size rather than the expression nesting depth. This
       helps prevent session termination due to stack overflow caused by
       recursive functions.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       The <function>length()</> function no longer counts trailing spaces in
       <type>CHAR(n)</> values.
      </para>
     </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Casting an integer to <type>BIT(N)</> selects the rightmost N bits of the
      integer, not the leftmost N bits as before.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Updating an element or slice of a NULL array value now produces
      a non-NULL array result, namely an array containing
      just the assigned-to positions.
     </para>
    </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       Syntax checking of array input values has been tightened up
       considerably. Junk that was previously allowed in odd places with
       odd results now causes an error. Empty-string element values
       must now be written as <literal>""</>, rather than writing nothing.
       Also changed behavior with respect to whitespace surrounding
       array elements: trailing whitespace is now ignored, for symmetry
       with leading whitespace (which has always been ignored).
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       Overflow in integer arithmetic operations is now detected and
       reported as an error.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       The arithmetic operators associated with the single-byte
       <type>"char"</> data type have been removed.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       The <function>extract()</> function (also called
       <function>date_part</>) now returns the proper year for BC dates.
       It previously returned one less than the correct year. The
       function now also returns the proper values for millennium and
       century.
      </para>
     </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      <type>CIDR</> values now must have their non-masked bits be zero.
      For example, we no longer allow
      <literal>204.248.199.1/31</literal> as a <type>CIDR</> value. Such
      values should never have been accepted by
      <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> and will now be rejected.
     </para>
    </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       <command>EXECUTE</command> now returns a completion tag that
       matches the executed statement.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       <application>psql</>'s <command>\copy</> command now reads or
       writes to the query's <literal>stdin/stdout</>, rather than
       <application>psql</>'s <literal>stdin/stdout</>. The previous
       behavior can be accessed via new
       <option>pstdin</>/<option>pstdout</> parameters.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
      The JDBC client interface has been removed from the core
      distribution, and is now hosted at <ulink url=
      "http://jdbc.postgresql.org">http://jdbc.postgresql.org</ulink>.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
      The Tcl client interface has also been removed. There are several
      Tcl interfaces now hosted at <ulink url=
      "http://gborg.postgresql.org">http://gborg.postgresql.org</ulink>.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       The server now uses its own time zone database, rather than the
       one supplied by the operating system. This will provide consistent
       behavior across all platforms.  In most cases, there should be
       little noticeable difference in time zone behavior, except that
       the time zone names used by <command>SET</>/<command>SHOW</>
       <varname>TimeZone</> may
       be different from what your platform provides.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       <application>Configure</>'s threading option no longer requires
       users to run tests or edit configuration files; threading options
       are now detected automatically.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       Now that tablespaces have been implemented,
       <application>initlocation</> has been removed.

  <sect2>
   <title>Deprecated Features</title>

   <para>
    Some aspects of <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>'s behavior
    have been determined to be suboptimal. For the sake of backward
    compatibility these have not been removed in 8.0, but they are
    considered deprecated and will be removed in the next major
    release.
    </para>

   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      The 8.1 release will remove the function
       <function>to_char(interval, text)</>.
     </para>
    </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       The server now warns of empty strings passed to
       <type>oid</type>/<type>float4</type>/<type>float8</type> data
       types, but continues to interpret them as zeroes as before.
       In the next major release, empty strings will be considered
       invalid input for these data types.
      </para>
     </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      By default, tables in <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> 8.0
      and earlier are created with <type>OID</>s. In the next release,
      this will <emphasis>not</emphasis> be the case: to create a table
      that contains <type>OID</>s, the <option>WITH OIDS</> clause must
      be specified or the <varname>default_with_oids</varname>
      configuration parameter must be set. Users are encouraged to
      explicitly specify <option>WITH OIDS</> if their tables
      require OIDs for compatibility with future releases of
      <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>.

   <title>Performance Improvements</title>
   <itemizedlist>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Support cross-data-type index usage (Tom)
     </para>
     <para>
      Before this change, many queries would not use an index if the data
      types did not match exactly. This improvement makes index usage more
      intuitive and consistent.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      New buffer replacement strategy that improves caching (Jan)
     </para>
     <para>
      Prior releases used a least-recently-used (LRU) cache to keep
      recently referenced pages in memory. The LRU algorithm
      did not consider the number of times a specific cache entry was
      accessed, so large table scans could force out useful cache pages.
      The new cache algorithm uses four separate lists to track most
      recently used and most frequently used cache pages and dynamically 
      optimize their replacement based on the work load. This should
      lead to much more efficient use of the shared buffer cache.
      Administrators who have tested shared buffer sizes in the past
      should retest with this new cache replacement policy.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Add subprocess to write dirty buffers periodically to reduce
      checkpoint writes (Jan)
     </para>
     <para>
      In previous releases, the checkpoint process, which runs every few
      minutes, would write all dirty buffers to the operating system's
      buffer cache then flush all dirty operating system buffers to
      disk. This resulted in a periodic spike in disk usage that often
      hurt performance. The new code uses a background writer to trickle
      disk writes at a steady pace so checkpoints have far fewer dirty
      pages to write to disk. Also, the new code does not issue a global
      <function>sync()</> call, but instead <function>fsync()</>s just
      the files written since the last checkpoint. This should improve
      performance and minimize degradation during checkpoints.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Add ability to prolong vacuum to reduce performance impact (Jan)
     </para>
     <para>
      On busy systems, <command>VACUUM</command> performs many I/O
      requests which can hurt performance for other users. This
      release allows you to slow down <command>VACUUM</command> to
      reduce its impact on other users, though this increases the
      total duration of <command>VACUUM</command>.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Improve B-tree index performance for duplicate keys (Dmitry Tkach, Tom)
     </para>
     <para>
      This improves the way indexes are scanned when many duplicate
      values exist in the index.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Use dynamically-generated table size estimates while planning (Tom)
     </para>
     <para>
      Formerly the planner estimated table sizes using the values seen
      by the last <command>VACUUM</command> or <command>ANALYZE</command>,
      both as to physical table size (number of pages) and number of rows.
      Now, the current physical table size is obtained from the kernel,
      and the number of rows is estimated by multiplying the table size
      by the row density (rows per page) seen by the last
      <command>VACUUM</command> or <command>ANALYZE</command>.  This should
      produce more reliable estimates in cases where the table size has
      changed significantly since the last housekeeping command.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Improved index usage with <literal>OR</> clauses (Tom)
     </para>
     <para>
      This allows the optimizer to use indexes in statements with many OR
      clauses that would not have been indexed in the past.  It can also use
      multi-column indexes where the first column is specified and the second
      column is part of an <literal>OR</> clause.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Improve matching of partial index clauses (Tom)
     </para>
     <para>
      The server is now smarter about using partial indexes in queries
      involving complex <option>WHERE</> clauses.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Improve performance of the GEQO optimizer (Tom)
     </para>

      <command>ANALYZE</command> now collects statistics for

     <para>
      Expression indexes (also called functional indexes) allow users to
      index not just columns but the results of expressions and function
      calls. With this release, the optimizer can gather and use statistics
      about the contents of expression indexes.  This will greatly improve
      the quality of planning for queries in which an expression index is
      relevant.

      Plan prepared queries only when first executed so constants can be

     <para>
      Prepared statements plan queries once and execute them many
      times. While prepared queries avoid the overhead of re-planning
      on each use, the quality of the plan suffers from not knowing the exact
      parameters to be used in the query.  In this release, planning of
      unnamed prepared statements is delayed until the first execution,
      and the actual parameter values of that execution are used as
      optimization hints.  This allows use of out-of-line parameter passing
      without incurring a performance penalty.

      Implement dollar quoting to simplify single-quote usage (Andrew, Tom, 
      David Fetter)
     </para>
     <para>
      In previous releases, because single quotes had to be used to
      quote a function's body, the use of single quotes inside the
      function text required use of two single quotes or other error-prone
      notations. With this release we add the ability to use "dollar
      quoting" to quote a block of text.  The ability to use different
      quoting delimiters at different nesting levels greatly simplifies
      the task of quoting correctly, especially in complex functions.
      Dollar quoting can be used anywhere quoted text is needed.

      Erase MD5 user passwords when a user is renamed (Bruce)
     </para>
     <para>
      <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> uses the user name as salt
      when encrypting passwords via MD5. When a user's name is changed,
      the salt will no longer match the stored MD5 password, so the
      stored password becomes useless.  In this release a notice is
      generated and the password is cleared.  A new password must then
      be assigned if the user is to be able to log in with a password.

      </para>
      <para>
       Formerly, the parser would select these operators in many situations
       where an <quote>unable to select an operator</> error would be more
       appropriate, such as <literal>null * null</>.  If you actually want
       to do arithmetic on a <type>"char"</> column, you can cast it to
       integer explicitly.

     <para>
       Formerly, both ways of writing an empty-string element value were

   <title>Server-Side Language Changes</title>
   <itemizedlist>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      In <literal>READ COMMITTED</> serialization mode, volatile functions
      now see the results of concurrent transactions committed up to the
      beginning of each statement within the function, rather than up to the
      beginning of the interactive command that called the function.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Functions declared <literal>STABLE</> or <literal>IMMUTABLE</> always
      use the snapshot of the calling query, and therefore do not see the
      effects of actions taken after the calling query starts, whether in
      their own transaction or other transactions.  Such a function must be
      read-only, too, meaning that it cannot use any SQL commands other than
      <command>SELECT</>.  There is a considerable performance gain from
      declaring a function <literal>STABLE</> or <literal>IMMUTABLE</>
      rather than <literal>VOLATILE</>.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Non-deferred <option>AFTER</> triggers are now fired immediately
      after completion of the triggering query, rather than upon
      finishing the current interactive command. This makes a difference
      when the triggering query occurred within a function: the trigger
      is invoked before the function proceeds to its next operation. For
      example, if a function inserts a new row into a table, any
      non-deferred foreign key checks occur before proceeding with the
      function.

   <title>Sortie 7.4.2</title>

   <note>
   <title>Date de sortie</title>
   <simpara>2004-03-08</simpara>
   </note>

   <para>
    Cette version contient quelques correctifs pour la 7.4.1.
   </para>


   <sect2>
    <title>Migration vers la version 7.4.2</title>

    <para>
     Une sauvegarde restauration n'est pas requise pour ceux utilisant une
     version 7.4.X. Nanmoins, c'est la mthode conseill car plus simple pour
     l'incorporation de la correction sur deux erreurs trouves dans le contenu
     initial des catalogues systmes de la 7.4. Une squence
     sauvegarde/initdb/restauration utilisant l'initdb de la 7.4.2 corrigera
     automatiquement ces problmes.
    </para>

    <para>
     La plus svre des deux erreurs est que le type de donnes
     <type>anyarray</> a un mauvais label d'alignement&nbsp;; ceci est un
     problme parce que le catalogue systme <structname>pg_statistic</> utilise
     des colonnes <type>anyarray</>. Ce mauvais label peut causer des mauvaises
     estimations du planificateur et mme des arrts brutaux lorsque des
     requtes de planification impliquent des clauses <literal>WHERE</> sur des
     colonnes doublement alignes doubles (telles que <type>float8</> et
     <type>timestamp</>). Il est fortement recommand que toutes les
     installations rparent cette erreur, soit par initdb soit en suivant la
     procdure de rparation manuelle donne ci-dessous.
    </para>

    <para>
     L'erreur moindre est que la vue systme <structname>pg_settings</> devrait
     tre marque comme ayant un accs public en mise  jour pour permettre
     l'utilisation de <literal>UPDATE pg_settings</> comme substitut pour
     <command>SET</>. Ceci peut tre corrig soit par initdb soit manuellement
     mais il n'est pas ncessaire de le corriger sauf si vous voulez utiliser
     <literal>UPDATE pg_settings</>.
    </para>

    <para>
     Si vous ne souhaitez pas lancer un initdb, la procdure suivante corrigera
     <structname>pg_statistic</>. En tant que superutilisateur de la base de
     donnes, faites&nbsp;:

<programlisting>
-- efface les anciennes donnes de pg_statistic :
DELETE FROM pg_statistic;
VACUUM pg_statistic;
-- ceci devrait mettre  jour 1 ligne :
UPDATE pg_type SET typalign = 'd' WHERE oid = 2277;
-- ceci devrait mettre  jour 6 lignes :
UPDATE pg_attribute SET attalign = 'd' WHERE atttypid = 2277;
--     
--  ce moment, vous DEVEZ lancer un nouveau moteur pour viter un arrt brutal
--
-- repopulate pg_statistic:
ANALYZE;
</programlisting>

     Ceci peut se faire sur une base de donnes en rel mais attention au fait
     que tous les serveurs de la base de donnes modifie doivent tre relancs
     avant qu'il ne soit sain de repeupler <structname>pg_statistic</>.
    </para>

    <para>
     Pour corriger l'erreur <structname>pg_settings</>, faites simplement&nbsp;:
<programlisting>
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON pg_settings TO PUBLIC;
</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
     Les procdures ci-dessus doivent tre excutes dans <emphasis>chaque</>
     base de donnes d'une installation, ceci incluant <literal>template1</>, et
     idalement <literal>template0</>. Si vous ne corrigez pas les bases de
     donnes modles, alors toute nouvelle base de donnes contiendra les mmes
     erreurs. <literal>template1</> peut tre corrig de la mme faon que toute
     autre base de donnes, mais corriger <literal>template0</> requiert
     quelques tapes supplmentaires. Tout d'abord,  partir de n'importe quelle

suprieure en parcourant squentiellement la sous-requte pour trouver une

<para>A patch applied in 7.3.3 to fix a corner case in rule permissions checks
turns out to have disabled rule-related permissions checks in many

they weren't supposed to have permission to insert into.  We have therefore
reverted the 7.3.3 patch.  The original bug will be fixed in 8.0.

Pour maintenant la cohrence dans le cas d'un arrt brutal du systme

foraient les modifications des donnes sur disque avant chaque validation de
transaction. Avec les WAL, seul un fichier de traces doit tre mis sur disque,
ce qui amliore grandement les performances. Si vous utilisiez -F dans les
prcdentes versions pour dsactiver les envois sur le disque, vous pourriez
considrer l'arrt de l'utilisation de cette option.

   <para>
    This release marks a major step in the development team's mastery of the
source
    code we inherited from Berkeley.  You will see we are now easily adding
    major features, thanks to the increasing size and experience of our
    world-wide development team.

    Here is a brief summary of the more notable changes:

       Multiversion concurrency control(MVCC)
      </term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        This removes our old table-level locking, and replaces it with
        a locking system that is superior to most commercial database
        systems.  In a traditional system, each row that is modified
        is locked until committed, preventing reads by other users.
        MVCC uses the natural multiversion nature of
        <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> to allow readers to
        continue reading consistent data during writer activity.
        Writers continue to use the compact pg_log transaction system.
        This is all performed without having to allocate a lock for
        every row like traditional database systems.  So, basically,
        we no longer are restricted by simple table-level locking; we
        have something better than row-level locking.

    <title>Migration vers la version 6.5</title>

    <para>
     A dump/restore using <application>pg_dump</application>
     is required for those wishing to migrate data from any
     previous release of <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>.
     <application>pg_upgrade</application> can <emphasis>not</emphasis>
     be used to upgrade to this release because the on-disk structure
     of the tables has changed compared to previous releases.
    </para>

    <para>
     The new Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC) features can
     give somewhat different behaviors in multiuser
     environments. <emphasis>Read and understand the following section 
      to ensure that your existing applications will give you the
      behavior you need.</emphasis>
    </para>

    <sect3>
     <title>Multiversion Concurrency Control</title>

     <para>
      Because readers in 6.5 don't lock data, regardless of transaction
      isolation level, data read by one transaction can be overwritten by
      another. In other words, if a row is returned by
      <command>SELECT</command> it doesn't mean that this row really exists
      at the time it is returned (i.e. sometime after the statement or
      transaction began) nor that the row is protected from being deleted or
      updated by concurrent transactions before the current transaction does
      a commit or rollback.
     </para>

     <para>
      To ensure the actual existence of a row and protect it against
      concurrent updates one must use <command>SELECT FOR UPDATE</command> or
      an appropriate <command>LOCK TABLE</command> statement. This should be
      taken into account when porting applications from previous releases of
      <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> and other environments.
     </para>

     <para>
      Keep the above in mind if you are using
      <filename>contrib/refint.*</filename> triggers for
      referential integrity. Additional techniques are required now. One way is
      to use <command>LOCK parent_table IN SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE MODE</command>
      command if a transaction is going to update/delete a primary key and
      use <command>LOCK parent_table IN SHARE MODE</command> command if a
      transaction is going to update/insert a foreign key.

      <note>
       <para>
        Note that if you run a transaction in SERIALIZABLE mode then you must
        execute the <command>LOCK</command> commands above before execution of
any
        <acronym>DML</acronym> statement
        (<command>SELECT/INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE/FETCH/COPY_TO</command>) in the
        transaction.
       </para>
      </note>
     </para>

     <para>
      These inconveniences will disappear in the future
      when the ability to read dirty
      (uncommitted) data (regardless of isolation level) and true referential
      integrity will be implemented.

<para>
There are <emphasis>many</emphasis> new features and improvements in this

Thanks to our developers and maintainers, nearly every aspect of the system
has received some attention since the previous release.
Here is a brief, incomplete summary:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
Views and rules are now functional thanks to extensive new code in the 
rewrite rules system from Jan Wieck. He also wrote a chapter on it
for the <citetitle>Programmer's Guide</citetitle>.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
Jan also contributed a second procedural language,
<application>PL/pgSQL</application>, to go with the
original <application>PL/pgTCL</application> procedural language he contributed
last release.

</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
We have optional multiple-byte character set support from Tatsuo Ishii
to complement our existing locale support.

<para>
Client/server communications has been cleaned up, with better support for
asynchronous messages and interrupts thanks to Tom Lane.

</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
The parser will now perform automatic type coercion to match arguments
to available operators and functions, and to match columns and expressions
with target columns. This uses a generic mechanism which supports
the type extensibility features of <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>.
There is a new chapter in the <citetitle>User's Guide</citetitle>
which covers this topic.
</para>

Three new data types have been added. 
Two types, <type>inet</type> and <type>cidr</type>, support various forms
of IP network, subnet, and machine addressing. There is now an 8-byte integer
type available on some platforms. See the chapter on data types
in the <citetitle>User's Guide</citetitle> for details.
A fourth type, <type>serial</type>, is now supported by the parser as an
amalgam of the <type>int4</type> type, a sequence, and a unique index.

   </para>

   <note>
    <para>
     Bruce Momjian wrote the following notes to introduce the new release.
    </para>
   </note>

   <para>
    There are some general 6.3 issues that I want to mention.  These are
    only the big items that can not be described in one sentence.  A review
    of the detailed changes list is still needed.
   </para>
   <para>
    First, we now have subselects.  Now that we have them, I would like to
    mention that without subselects, SQL is a very limited language.
    Subselects are a major feature, and you should review your code for
    places where subselects provide a better solution for your queries.  I
    think you will find that there are more uses for subselects than you may
    think.  Vadim has put us on the big SQL map with subselects, and fully
    functional ones too.  The only thing you can't do with subselects is to
    use them in the target list.
   </para>
   <para>
    Second, 6.3 uses Unix domain sockets rather than TCP/IP by default.  To
    enable connections from other machines, you have to use the new
    postmaster -i option, and of course edit <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename>. 
Also, for this
    reason, the format of <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename> has changed.
   </para>
   <para>
    Third, <type>char()</type> fields will now allow faster access than
<type>varchar()</type> or
    <type>text</type>. Specifically, the <type>text</> and
<type>varchar()</type> have a penalty for access to
    any columns after the first column of this type.  <type>char()</type> used
to also
    have this access penalty, but it no longer does.  This may suggest that
    you redesign some of your tables, especially if you have short character
    columns that you have defined as <type>varchar()</type> or
<type>text</type>.  This and other
    changes make 6.3 even faster than earlier releases.
   </para>
   <para>
    We now have passwords definable independent of any Unix file.  There are
    new SQL USER commands.
    See the <citetitle>Administrator's Guide</citetitle> for more
    information.  There is a new table, pg_shadow, which is used to store
    user information and user passwords, and it by default only SELECT-able
    by the <systemitem>postgres</systemitem> super-user.  pg_user is now a view
of pg_shadow, and is
    SELECT-able by PUBLIC.  You should keep using pg_user in your
    application without changes.
   </para>
   <para>
    User-created tables now no longer have SELECT privilege to PUBLIC by
    default.  This was done because the ANSI standard requires it.  You can
    of course GRANT any privileges you want after the table is created. 
    System tables continue to be SELECT-able by PUBLIC.
   </para>
   <para>
    We also have real deadlock detection code.  No more sixty-second
    timeouts.  And the new locking code implements a <acronym>FIFO</acronym>
better, so there
    should be less resource starvation during heavy use.
   </para>
   <para>
    Many complaints have been made about inadequate documentation in previous
    releases.  Thomas has put much effort into many new manuals for this
    release.  Check out the doc/ directory.
   </para>
   <para>
    For performance reasons, time travel is gone, but can be implemented
    using triggers (see <filename>pgsql/contrib/spi/README</filename>).  Please
check out the new
    \d command for types, operators, etc.  Also, views have their own
    privileges now, not based on the underlying tables, so privileges on
    them have to be set separately.  Check
<filename>/pgsql/interfaces</filename> for some new
    ways to talk to <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>.
   </para>
   <para>
    This is the first release that really required an explanation for
    existing users.  In many ways, this was necessary because the new
    release removes many limitations, and the work-arounds people were using
    are no longer needed.

<title>Sortie 6.1</title>

   <note>
   <title>Date de sortie</title>
   <simpara>1997-06-08</simpara>
   </note>

<para>
  The regression tests have been adapted and extensively modified for the
  6.1 release of <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>.
</para>

<para>
  Three new data types (<type>datetime</type>, <type>timespan</type>, and
<type>circle</type>) have been added to
  the native set of <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> types. Points, boxes,
paths, and polygons
  have had their output formats made consistent across the data types.
  The polygon output in misc.out has only been spot-checked for correctness
  relative to the original regression output.
</para>

<para>
  <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> 6.1 introduces a new, alternate
optimizer which uses <firstterm>genetic</firstterm>
  algorithms. These algorithms introduce a random behavior in the ordering
  of query results when the query contains multiple qualifiers or multiple
  tables (giving the optimizer a choice on order of evaluation). Several
  regression tests have been modified to explicitly order the results, and
  hence are insensitive to optimizer choices. A few regression tests are
  for data types which are inherently unordered (e.g. points and time
  intervals) and tests involving those types are explicitly bracketed with
  <command>set geqo to 'off'</command> and <command>reset geqo</command>.
</para>

<para>
  The interpretation of array specifiers (the curly braces around atomic
  values) appears to have changed sometime after the original regression
  tests were generated. The current <filename>./expected/*.out</filename> files
reflect this
  new interpretation, which may not be correct!
</para>

<para>
  The float8 regression test fails on at least some platforms. This is due
  to differences in implementations of <function>pow()</function> and
<function>exp()</function> and the signaling
  mechanisms used for overflow and underflow conditions.
</para>

<para>
  The <quote>random</> results in the random test should cause the
  <quote>random</quote> test to be <quote>failed</quote>, since the
  regression tests are evaluated using a simple diff. However,
  <quote>random</> does not seem to produce random results on my test
  machine (Linux/<application>gcc</>/i686).

Add the new built-in functions and operators of 1.02.1 to 1.01 or 1.02
   databases.  This is done by running the new 1.02.1 server against
   your own 1.01 or 1.02 database and applying the queries attached at
   the end of the file.   This can be done easily through <command>psql</>.  If
your
   1.01 or 1.02 database is named <literal>testdb</literal> and you have cut the
commands
   from the end of this file and saved them in <filename>addfunc.sql</filename>:
<programlisting>
        % psql testdb -f addfunc.sql
</programlisting>

Those upgrading 1.02 databases will get a warning when executing the
last two statements in the file because they are already present in 1.02.  This
is
not a cause for concern.

<title>Dump/Reload Procedure</title>

<para>
If you are trying to reload a pg_dump or text-mode, <literal>copy tablename to
stdout</literal> generated with a previous version, you will need to run the
attached <command>sed</command> script on the ASCII file before loading it into
the
database.  The old format used '.' as end-of-data, while '\.' is now the
end-of-data marker.  Also, empty strings are now loaded in as '' rather
than NULL. See the copy manual page for full details.

<programlisting>
        sed 's/^\.$/\\./g' &lt;in_file &gt;out_file
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
If you are loading an older binary copy or non-<systemitem>stdout</> copy, there
is no
end-of-data character, and hence no conversion necessary.

<title>Migration from version 1.0 to version 1.01</title>

<para>
The following notes are for the benefit of users who want to migrate
databases from <productname>Postgres95</> 1.0 to <productname>Postgres95</>
1.01.  
</para>
<para>
If you are starting afresh with <productname>Postgres95</> 1.01 and do not need
to migrate old databases, you do not need to read any further.
</para>
<para>
In order to <productname>Postgres95</> version 1.01 with databases created with
<productname>Postgres95</> version 1.0, the following steps are required:  
</para>
<procedure>
<step>
<para>
Set the definition of <symbol>NAMEDATALEN</symbol> in
<filename>src/Makefile.global</filename> to 16
   and <symbol>OIDNAMELEN</symbol> to 20.
</para>
</step>
<step>
<para>
Decide whether you want to use Host based authentication.  
</para>
<substeps>
<step>
<para>
If you do, you must create a file name <literal>pg_hba</literal> in your
top-level data
   directory (typically the value of your <envar>$PGDATA</envar>). 
<filename>src/libpq/pg_hba</filename>
   shows an example syntax.
</para>
</step>
<step>
<para>
If you do not want host-based authentication, you can comment out
   the line
<programlisting>
        HBA = 1
</programlisting>
   in <filename>src/Makefile.global</filename>
</para>
<para>
   Note that host-based authentication is turned on by default, and if
   you do not take steps A or B above, the out-of-the-box 1.01 will
   not allow you to connect to 1.0 databases.
</para>
</step>
</substeps>
</step>

<step>
<para>
Compile and install 1.01, but DO NOT do the <command>initdb</command> step.
</para>
</step>
<step>
<para>
Before doing anything else, terminate your 1.0 postmaster, and
   backup your existing <envar>$PGDATA</envar> directory.   
</para>
</step>
<step>
<para>
Set your <envar>PGDATA</envar> environment variable to your 1.0 databases, but
set up
   path up so that 1.01 binaries are being used.
</para>
</step>
<step>
<para>
Modify the file <filename><envar>$PGDATA</envar>/PG_VERSION</filename> from 5.0
to 5.1
</para>
</step>
<step>
<para>
Start up a new 1.01 postmaster
</para>
</step>
<step>
<para>
Add the new built-in functions and operators of 1.01 to 1.0
   databases.  This is done by running the new 1.01 server against
   your own 1.0 database and applying the queries attached and saving 
   in the file 1.0_to_1.01.sql.   This can be done easily through
<command>psql</command>.
   If your 1.0 database is name <literal>testdb</literal>:

<programlisting>
        % psql testdb -f 1.0_to_1.01.sql
</programlisting>

and then execute the following commands (cut and paste from here):

<programlisting>
-- add builtin functions that are new to 1.01

create function int4eqoid (int4, oid) returns bool as 'foo'
language 'internal';
create function oideqint4 (oid, int4) returns bool as 'foo'

<programlisting>
Incompatibilities:
 * 1.01 is backwards compatible with 1.0 database provided the user
   follow the steps outlined in the MIGRATION_from_1.0_to_1.01 file.
   If those steps are not taken, 1.01 is not compatible with 1.0 database.

Enhancements:
 * added PQdisplayTuples() to libpq and changed monitor and psql to use it
 * added NeXT port (requires SysVIPC implementation)
 * added CAST .. AS ... syntax
 * added ASC and DESC key words
 * added 'internal' as a possible language for CREATE FUNCTION
   internal functions are C functions which have been statically linked
   into the postgres backend.
 * a new type "name" has been added for system identifiers (table names,
   attribute names, etc.)  This replaces the old char16 type.   The
   of name is set by the NAMEDATALEN #define in src/Makefile.global
 * a readable reference manual that describes the query language.
 * added host-based access control.  A configuration file ($PGDATA/pg_hba)
   is used to hold the configuration data.  If host-based access control
   is not desired, comment out HBA=1 in src/Makefile.global.
 * changed regex handling to be uniform use of Henry Spencer's regex code
   regardless of platform.  The regex code is included in the distribution
 * added functions and operators for case-insensitive regular expressions. 
   The operators are ~* and !~*.
 * pg_dump uses COPY instead of SELECT loop for better performance

Bug fixes:
 * fixed an optimizer bogue that was causing core dumps when 
   functions calls were used in comparisons in the WHERE clause
 * changed all uses of getuid to geteuid so that effective uids are used
 * psql now returns non-zero status on errors when using -c
 * applied public patches 1-14

Copyright change:
 * The copyright of <productname>Postgres</productname> 1.0 has been loosened to
be freely modifiable
   and modifiable for any purpose.  Please read the COPYRIGHT file.
   Thanks to Professor Michael Stonebraker for making this possible.

Incompatibilities:
 *  date formats have to be MM-DD-YYYY (or DD-MM-YYYY if you're using
   EUROPEAN STYLE).  This follows SQL-92 specs.
 *  "delimiters" is now a key word

Enhancements:
 *  sql LIKE syntax has been added
 *  copy command now takes an optional USING DELIMITER specification.
   delimiters can be any single-character string. 
 *  IRIX 5.3 port has been added.
   Thanks to Paul Walmsley and others.
 *  updated pg_dump to work with new libpq
 *  \d has been added psql 
   Thanks to Keith Parks
 *  regexp performance for architectures that use POSIX regex has been
   improved due to caching of precompiled patterns.
   Thanks to Alistair Crooks
 *  a new version of libpq++
   Thanks to William Wanders

Bug fixes:
 *  arbitrary userids can be specified in the createuser script
 *  \c to connect to other databases in psql now works.
 *  bad pg_proc entry for float4inc() is fixed
 *  users with usecreatedb field set can now create databases without
   having to be usesuper
 *  remove access control entries when the entry no longer has any
   privileges
 *  fixed non-portable datetimes implementation
 *  added kerberos flags to the src/backend/Makefile
 *  libpq now works with kerberos
 *  typographic errors in the user manual have been corrected.
 *  btrees with multiple index never worked, now we tell you they don't
   work when you try to use them

<programlisting>
Incompatible changes:
 * BETA-0.3 IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH DATABASES CREATED WITH PREVIOUS VERSIONS
   (due to system catalog changes and indexing structure changes).
 * double-quote (") is deprecated as a quoting character for string literals;
   you need to convert them to single quotes ('). <!-- " -->
 * name of aggregates (eg. int4sum) are renamed in accordance with the
   SQL standard (eg. sum).
 * CHANGE ACL syntax is replaced by GRANT/REVOKE syntax.
 * float literals (eg. 3.14) are now of type float4 (instead of float8 in
   previous releases); you might have to do typecasting if you depend on it
   being of type float8.  If you neglect to do the typecasting and you assign
   a float literal to a field of type float8, you may get incorrect values
   stored!
 * LIBPQ has been totally revamped so that frontend applications
   can connect to multiple backends
 * the usesysid field in pg_user has been changed from int2 to int4 to
   allow wider range of Unix user ids.
 * the netbsd/freebsd/bsd o/s ports have been consolidated into a
   single BSD44_derived port.  (thanks to Alistair Crooks)

SQL standard-compliance (the following details changes that makes postgres95
more compliant to the SQL-92 standard):
 * the following SQL types are now built-in: smallint, int(eger), float, real,
   char(N), varchar(N), date and time.

   The following are aliases to existing postgres types:
                smallint -&gt; int2
                integer, int -&gt; int4
                float, real  -&gt; float4
   char(N) and varchar(N) are implemented as truncated text types. In
   addition, char(N) does blank-padding. 
 * single-quote (') is used for quoting string literals; '' (in addition to
   \') is supported as means of inserting a single quote in a string
 * SQL standard aggregate names (MAX, MIN, AVG, SUM, COUNT) are used
   (Also, aggregates can now be overloaded, i.e. you can define your
   own MAX aggregate to take in a user-defined type.)
 * CHANGE ACL removed. GRANT/REVOKE syntax added.  
   - Privileges can be given to a group using the "GROUP" key word.
        For example:
                GRANT SELECT ON foobar TO GROUP my_group;
        The key word 'PUBLIC' is also supported to mean all users.      

        Privileges can only be granted or revoked to one user or group
        at a time.  

        "WITH GRANT OPTION" is not supported.  Only class owners can change
        access control
   - The default access control is to to grant users readonly access.
     You must explicitly grant insert/update access to users.  To change
     this, modify the line in 
                src/backend/utils/acl.h 
     that defines ACL_WORLD_DEFAULT 

Bug fixes:
 * the bogue where aggregates of empty tables were not run has been fixed. Now,
   aggregates run on empty tables will return the initial conditions of the
   aggregates. Thus, COUNT of an empty  table will now properly return 0.
   MAX/MIN of an empty table will return a row of value NULL. 
 * allow the use of \; inside the monitor
 * the LISTEN/NOTIFY asynchronous notification mechanism now work
 * NOTIFY in rule action bodies now work
 * hash indexes work, and access methods in general should perform better.
   creation of large btree indexes should be much faster.  (thanks to Paul
   Aoki)

Other changes and enhancements:
 * addition of an EXPLAIN statement used for explaining the query execution
   plan (eg. "EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM EMP" prints out the execution plan for
   the query).
 * WARN and NOTICE messages no longer have timestamps on them. To turn on
   timestamps of error messages, uncomment the line in
   src/backend/utils/elog.h:
        /* define ELOG_TIMESTAMPS */ 
 * On an access control violation, the message
        "Either no such class or insufficient privilege"
   will be given.  This is the same message that is returned when
   a class is not found.  This dissuades non-privileged users from
   guessing the existence of privileged classes.
 * some additional system catalog changes have been made that are not
   visible to the user.

libpgtcl changes:
 * The -oid option has been added to the "pg_result" tcl command.
   pg_result -oid returns oid of the last row inserted.   If the
   last command was not an INSERT, then pg_result -oid returns "".
 * the large object interface is available as pg_lo* tcl commands:
   pg_lo_open, pg_lo_close, pg_lo_creat, etc.

Portability enhancements and New Ports:
 * flex/lex problems have been cleared up.  Now, you should be able to use
   flex instead of lex on any platforms.  We no longer make assumptions of
   what lexer you use based on the platform you use. 
 * The Linux-ELF port is now supported.  Various configuration have been 
   tested:  The following configuration is known to work:
        kernel 1.2.10, gcc 2.6.3, libc 4.7.2, flex 2.5.2, bison 1.24
   with everything in ELF format,

New utilities:
 * ipcclean added to the distribution
   ipcclean usually does not need to be run, but if your backend crashes
   and leaves shared memory segments hanging around, ipcclean will
   clean them up for you.

New documentation:
 * the user manual has been revised and libpq documentation added.

Incompatible changes:
 * The SQL statement for creating a database is 'CREATE DATABASE' instead
   of 'CREATEDB'. Similarly, dropping a database is 'DROP DATABASE' instead
   of 'DESTROYDB'. However, the names of the executables 'createdb' and 
   'destroydb' remain the same.
 
New tools:
 * pgperl - a Perl (4.036) interface to Postgres95
 * pg_dump - a utility for dumping out a postgres database into a
        script file containing query commands. The script files are in a ASCII
        format and can be used to reconstruct the database, even on other
        machines and other architectures. (Also good for converting
        a Postgres 4.2 database to Postgres95 database.)

The following ports have been incorporated into postgres95-beta-0.02:
 * the NetBSD port by Alistair Crooks
 * the AIX port by Mike Tung
 * the Windows NT port by Jon Forrest (more stuff but not done yet)
 * the Linux ELF port by Brian Gallew

The following bogues have been fixed in postgres95-beta-0.02:
 * new lines not escaped in COPY OUT and problem with COPY OUT when first
   attribute is a '.' 
 * cannot type return to use the default user id in createuser
 * SELECT DISTINCT on big tables crashes
 * Linux installation problems
 * monitor doesn't allow use of 'localhost' as PGHOST
 * psql core dumps when doing \c or \l
 * the "pgtclsh" target missing from src/bin/pgtclsh/Makefile
 * libpgtcl has a hard-wired default port number
 * SELECT DISTINCT INTO TABLE hangs
 * CREATE TYPE doesn't accept 'variable' as the internallength
 * wrong result using more than 1 aggregate in a SELECT
